[2025-5-25 11:27:25] Fetching CL + BL from 2D document
[2025-5-25 11:27:25] Found CL and BL groups
[2025-5-25 11:27:25] Step 1: Extracting pattern from PatCol file...
[2025-5-25 11:27:27] Pattern copied from PatCol file to 2D document
[2025-5-25 11:27:27] Protected 0 disclaimer text items
[2025-5-25 11:27:27] Step 2: Scaling pattern to match CL height...
[2025-5-25 11:27:27] Original dimensions: Width: 320.35 pts, Height: 566.93 pts
[2025-5-25 11:27:27] Scaling uniformly by 0.7739 to match CL height (438.77 pts)
[2025-5-25 11:27:27] Pattern scaled and centered
[2025-5-25 11:27:27] Step 3: Creating clipping mask...
[2025-5-25 11:27:27] Clipping path derived from largest path (80097 ptsì§¼)
[2025-5-25 11:27:27] Step 4: Assembling final Target group...
[2025-5-25 11:27:27] Target group assembled + clipping applied
[2025-5-25 11:27:27] Step 5: Saving final EPS file...
